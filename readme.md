# Kernel Optimization

This project aims to optimite basic computation kernels in CPU and GPU. The basic kernels conclude:

- Elementwise
- Reduce
- GEMM
- GEMV
- SPMV
- Conv

And the project need realizing below codes:

- Serial
- AVX-512
- SVE(arm)
- OpenMP
- MPI
- CUDA

We would like to realize those kernels by C++ 11 standard.
