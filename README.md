# Kernel Optimization

This project aims to optimite basic computation kernels in CPU and GPU. The basic kernels conclude:

- Reduce(Need Moving)
- GEMM(DOING CUDA part)
- Conv(TODO)
- SPMV(TODO)

And the project need realizing in below codes:

- AVX-512
- SVE
- CUDA

with
- OpenMP
- MPI

We would like to realize those kernels by at least C++ 11 standard.
